## Goals
<!-- What we expect to get from the day -->
- Managing sessions in Phoenix.
- Hashing strings.
- Authentication.
- Ecto changeset.
- Plugs in Phoenix.

## Resources
<!-- How are we going to achieve it -->

### Phoenix: Plugs

If we want to share a plug across more than one module, we can define the plug as a module, it should have two functions:

1. `init(opts)`.
2. `call(conn, _opts)`.

> The `call(conn, _opts)` receive an `_opts` param in case a programmer needs to modify the passed options to change the behavior of the plug.
>
> In the `init(opts)`, Plug will use the result of `init(opts)` as the second argument in `call(conn, _opts)`.
>
> In _development mode_, Phoenix calls `init` at runtime, but in _production mode_ `init` is only called once at _compile time_. This strategy makes `init` the optimal place to validate and transform `opts` without slowing down every request.

In relationship to our previous JavaScript knowledge base, think of _Plugs_ as _NestJs's interceptors_, or _ExpressJs's middleware_.
