## Goals
<!-- What we expect to get from the day -->
- Complete "Part I" of "Programming Elixir".

## Resources
<!-- How are we going to achieve it -->
- [book] Programming Elixir 1.6

## Outcomes
<!-- What we actually got -->
- How functions can be defined with different params.
- The use of guards in functions.

## Notes
<!-- Relevant notes to the day's progress -->

### Using Head and Tail to build a list

```elixir
defmodule MyList do
 # Look at the parameters patterns for the two
 # definitions of square. The first matches an
 # empty list and the second matches all other
 # lists.

  def square([]), do: []
  def square([ head, tail ]) do
    [ head * head | MyList.square(tail) ]
  end

 # Second, look at the body of the second
 # definition. When we match a non-empty list,
 # we return a new list whose head is the square
 # of the original list's head and whose tail is
 # a list of squares of the tail. This is the
 # recursive step.
end
```

## Next steps
<!-- What we will be working on tomorrow -->

## Resources worth checking out
<!-- Other resources we could benefit from -->
