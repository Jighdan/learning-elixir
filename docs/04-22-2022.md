## Goals
<!-- What we expect to get from the day -->
- Compare "Programming Elixir" book exercise solutions.
- Keep familiarizing with Phoenix.
- Ecto

## Resources
<!-- How are we going to achieve it -->
- [book] Programming Phoenix

## Outcomes
<!-- What we actually got -->
- Phoenix controllers, contexts, views, templates.
- Ecto schemas, migrations
- Ecto changesets

## Notes
<!-- Relevant notes to the day's progress -->

### Phoenix: Naming Conventions

When Phoenix renders templates from a `controller`, it infers the name of the `view` module, `App.PageView`, from the name of the `controller` module, `App.PageController`. The `view` modules infer their `template` locations from the `view` module name.

In our example, our `App.PageView` would look for templates in the `web/templates/page` directory.

Phoenix uses explicit names you provided throughout, wheter singular or plural. That strategy avoids confusing pluralization rules and naming inconsistencies
 you might find in other frameworks.
