## Goals
<!-- What we expect to get from the day -->
- Private functions.
- Pipe operator.
- Modules attributes.
- Heads and tails of a list.
- Lists and recursion.
- Phoenix introduction.

## Resources
<!-- How are we going to achieve it -->
- [book] Programming Elixir >= 1.6
- [book] Programming Phoenix >= 1.4

## Outcomes
<!-- What we actually got -->

## Notes
<!-- Relevant notes to the day's progress -->

### Choosing between maps, structs and keyword lists

- Do I want to pattern-match against the contents (for example: matching a dictionary has the key of `:name` somewhere in it)? _Use a `map`_.

- Will I want more than one entry with the same key? _Use the `Keyword` module_.

- Do I need to guarantee the elements are ordered? _Use the `Keyword` module_.

- Do I have a fixed set of fields? _Use a `struct`_.

- Otherwise, if you've reached this point: _Use a `map`_.

## Next steps
<!-- What we will be working on tomorrow -->

## Resources worth checking out
