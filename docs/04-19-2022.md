## Goals
<!-- What we expect to get from the day -->
- Immutability.
- Lists and Recursions.
- Maps, Keyword Lists, Sets and Structs.

## Resources
<!-- How are we going to achieve it -->
- [book] Programing Elixir.

## Outcomes
<!-- What we actually got -->

## Notes
<!-- Relevant notes to the day's progress -->

### PIDs and Ports

A PID is a reference to a process (local or remote), and a port is a reference to a resource
 (typically external to the application) that you'll be reading or writting.

### Lists

Elixir has some operators that work specifically on lists:

```elixir
# concanetation
iex> [ 1, 2, 3 ] ++ [ 4, 5, 6 ]
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]

# difference
iex> [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] -- [ 2, 4 ]
[ 1, 3 ]

# membership
iex> 1 in [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
true

iex> "wombat" in [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
false
```

## Next steps
<!-- What we will be working on tomorrow -->

## Resources worth checking out
<!-- Other resources we could benefit from -->
