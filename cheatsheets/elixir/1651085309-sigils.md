# Elixir: Sigils

A sigil starts with a tilde, followed by an upper- or lowercase letter, some delimited content, and perhaps some options. The delimeters can be `<...>`, `{...}`, `[...]`, `|...|`, `/.../`, `"..."`, and `'...'`.

The letter determines the sigil's type:

- `~C`: A character list with no escaping or interpolation.
- `~c`: A character list, escaped and interpolated just like a single-quoted string.
- `~D`: A `Date` in the format of `yyyy-mm-dd`.
- `~N`: A naive (raw) `DateTime` in the format `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss[.ddd]`.
- `~R`: A regular expression with no escaping or interpolation.
- `~r`: A regular expression, escaped and interpolated.
- `~S`: A string with no escaping or interpolation.
- `~s`: A string, escaped and interpolated just like a double-quoted string.
- `~T`: A `Time` in the format `hh:mm:ss[.dddd]`.
- `~W`: A list of whitespace-delimited words, with no escaping or interpolation.
- `~w`: A list of whitespace-delimited words, with escaping and interpolation.
